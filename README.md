## Professional experience:

### Udvikings- og Forenklingsstyrelsen - 2022-present

Java developer turned DevOps for Spring Boot based backends written in Java and Kotlin deployed to Kubernetes accessed from mobile apps frontends.

* Migration to GitOps-based deployments.
* Worked on consolidating Jenkins-based pipelines across products building and deploying backends to our on-prem Rancher Kubernetes clusters.
* Connectivity and external networking access allowing our frontends to reach the backends inside the UFST network.
* Prototyped multiple possibly interesting Linux, Java and Python based technologies.  This includes  eBPF, OpenAPI, SonarQube, Cucumber, Flight Recorder Fire Graphs and Jira REST API.
* Create and maintain YAML files for Continuous Deployments.
* Enhanced backends to provide monitoring information through Spring Boot actuators allowing backend health wallboards using Spring Boot Admin.
* Introduced "code near"-documentation using AsciiDoc allowing live code snippets in IDE and Confluence.



### Viking Software - 2021

Project employment in two phases. First converting an existing end-user Visual Basic application talking to MS SQL to a REST-based web solution. Secondly completely replacing application and operating system on existing customer devices with a Qt5 application running on Alpine Linux.  I was responsible for the C# backend and the Linux installer in the two phases.

// Three subjects, project 1, project 2, evt 
* Created single fully automated Alpine Linux installation ISO image covering all four types of customer PC hardware and network configurations.  It was a goal that the technician doing the installations in the field should not have to do anything requiring a keyboard during the installation.  This was both very technically challenging and very rewarding to do. 
* Used git (command line + Gitlab) and Docker on daily basis for development.
* Reimplemented all existing customer reports data extraction written in SQL inside Visual Basic using multiple databases as C# .NET 3.1  endpoints using Entity Framework with reversed engineered scaffolded classes from our test data docker image.
* Implemented Gitlab CI/CD build procedures for all of our deployed artifacts. This was several C# components, the React web frontend, the Qt5 application, and the installer ISO generation.
* Rebuilt Qt5 Alpine packages used by our Qt5 application to support instruction set in the oldest PC's still used by customer.
* Created and maintained SQL Server 2019 Docker image hosted on internal Gitlab used by team to develop with test data provided by customer in various forms, including incremental changes.
* NAT-router functionality for built-in GSM network connection.
* Designed and implemented rsync server layout for downloading new location specific versions of the Qt5 application with a minimum of network traffic over GSM.

* Researched and wrote
components in Java for those tasks not easily done in COBOL, like
handling XML, image transformations and network transportation of data using a variety of protocols.

* Co-designed and implemented a central API allowing the usage of Java applications as COBOL-components. As these usually run unattended they need to be extremely robust and produce high quality logs for offline debugging.
